                  1.Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand, arms fully extended down by your sides, and palms
                  facing forward.2.Keep your elbows close to your torso and exhale as you curl the weights upward by
                  bending your elbows, ensuring only your forearms move.3.Continue curling until your biceps are fully
                  contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold this position for a moment, squeezing your
                  biceps.4.Inhale as you slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, maintaining control
                  and keeping tension on your biceps.5.Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.(It is recommended
                  you start with less weight and more reps as it will help in muscle growth)
